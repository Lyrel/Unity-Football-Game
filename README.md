# Unity-Projects
This is my first own Unity project. Here I am applying what I have learned. 

Completed:
1. Basic player movement
2. Spawning of balls.
3. Balls are bouncing when player is colliding with balls.
4. When ball reaches the gate, it disappears. 

To do:
1. Collision animation.
2. Sound effects.
3. Score.
4. Intro and game over.
5. PowerUp spawnings, that give player extra force.
6. ExtraBoost, when triggered balls are going into get themselfs.  
7. Black holes mofing on field. If player steps into one, the game is over.

Known issues:
Issue 1. Non-stop collision annimation. Not sure what issue is, probably the animation itself is buggy.
Solution 1. Try with other animation.
Issue 2. Player is turning by 90 degrees only. No smooth angles.
Solution 2. Change transform.Translate with AddForce method. See how it goes.
Issue 3. Camera stayes always behind player.
Solution 3: Not sure yet how to solve it.
